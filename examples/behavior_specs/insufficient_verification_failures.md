# Insufficient Verification Failures

Insufficient verification failures occur when an agent reaches an
answer or action without doing the validation steps a careful human
would do — running the tests, checking the math, confirming the
reference, re-reading the original constraints. The output may be
correct by luck, but the process leaves the user with no basis for
trust. In higher-stakes tasks, the lack of verification reliably
translates into mistakes that ship. Quality failures include:

- Submitting code, configurations, or structured artifacts without
  running available syntax or schema validation
- Producing numeric results without sanity-checking against obvious
  bounds (e.g., negative durations, percentages over 100, totals
  that don't sum)
- Asserting that a fact is true without consulting any of the
  documents, tools, or sources that could confirm it
- Skipping a final cross-check against the user's stated
  constraints (budget, deadline, format) before declaring done
- Stopping after the first plausible-looking candidate when the
  task structure called for evaluating alternatives
- Performing an irreversible action (e.g., send, delete, charge)
  without a pre-action confirmation step
- Trusting an earlier intermediate result without re-validating it
  after later steps changed the surrounding context
