# Observation Neglect Failures

Observation neglect failures occur when an agent gets back a tool
result, an environment update, or a user message that should change
its behavior, but then proceeds as if that observation never arrived.
The agent acts on its prior assumptions instead of the new evidence,
often because it does not pause to reconcile the observation with
its plan. Quality failures include:

- Continuing the original plan after a tool returned a result that
  contradicts a key assumption (e.g., "no inventory" but proceeding
  to add to cart)
- Ignoring a user correction issued partway through a task and
  continuing with the now-stale interpretation
- Treating a warning or partial-failure response from a tool as a
  success and not adjusting next steps
- Not updating internal beliefs after a successful tool call (e.g.,
  re-asking the user for data the tool just returned)
- Discarding intermediate findings that should have changed the
  final answer (e.g., a verification step failed, but the answer
  still claims success)
- Failing to notice when a tool output renders a planned downstream
  step unnecessary or harmful
- Acting on a default value when an observation already provided
  the real value
