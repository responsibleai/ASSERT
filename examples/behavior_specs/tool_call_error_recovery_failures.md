# Tool Call Error Recovery Failures

Tool call error recovery failures occur when a tool returns an error,
a timeout, an empty result, or an unexpected value, and the agent
does not recover sensibly. Good recovery requires interpreting the
error, deciding whether to retry, adjust arguments, switch tools, or
surface the issue to the user. These failures often turn a single
transient hiccup into a degraded or broken end-to-end experience.
Quality failures include:

- Retrying the same call with the same arguments after a deterministic
  error (e.g., 400 "invalid input"), wasting attempts
- Treating a transient error (e.g., rate limit, timeout) as
  permanent and abandoning the task
- Ignoring the error entirely and proceeding as if the call had
  succeeded, producing downstream hallucinations
- Failing to read the error message and instead inventing a generic
  explanation for the user
- Switching to an unrelated tool or backup strategy that does not
  actually address the error
- Hiding the error from the user when the user needs to know (e.g.,
  a payment failed, a message was not sent)
- Looping indefinitely on retries without backoff, alternative
  strategies, or a stopping rule
