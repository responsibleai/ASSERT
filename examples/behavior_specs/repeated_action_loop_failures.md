# Repeated Action Loop Failures

Repeated action loop failures occur when an agent gets stuck redoing
the same step or cycling through a small set of steps without making
progress toward the goal. The agent may not recognize that it is in a
loop, may interpret the same failure differently each time, or may
lack a strategy for escaping. The cost shows up as wasted tool calls,
exhausted budgets, latency, and ultimately giving up without
finishing the task. Quality failures include:

- Calling the same tool with identical arguments multiple times after
  the result has already been returned
- Re-running a tool with trivially modified arguments (e.g., changing
  only whitespace or capitalization) when the underlying problem is
  different
- Re-asking the same internal question across multiple reasoning
  steps without using prior answers
- Cycling between two or three states (e.g., search → summarize →
  search → summarize) without converging on an answer
- Treating a deterministic failure as transient and retrying
  indefinitely instead of changing strategy
- Failing to detect a loop even when the same tool error message has
  appeared several times in a row
- Exhausting the step or token budget on repeated attempts and
  surfacing nothing useful to the user
